I Steps to run the server side
1) Run the Server on the terminal using the following command: $python Server.py (We have used python version 2.7)

II Steps to run the client side

1) Copy all the rfcs(that you you want to make available as a peer server)and Client.py in a single folder and run the centralized server on some other machine.
2) By Default we have added 1 rfc. Its name is RFC123 and the name is IP. So please have it in your working folder before you start the client code.
3) Open the Client terminal using the following command: $python Client.py

III Steps for Peer-to-Peer Application

1) Rename the RFC in the following format within the folder containing the Client.py python file as : RFC<number>.txt. For example: RFC123.txt.
